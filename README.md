 # [MY PORTFOLIO](https://mmtovarm.github.io/)

The goal of this project is to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS I have learned during the SheCodes learning program and showcase it to my mentors for feedback.
I am inspired on aesthically clean websites but I wou like to incorporate colour somehow to portray my latinamerican backgroung and the joy it brings to me. Initally I will incorporate it with the images to comply with the requirements of the project and as I have chance to play with it I will find fun and diferent ways to do it.
Since, I have had a canvas shock and did not how to start, I have drawn on a very basic wireframe to be able to work my way thru understanding the basics and work my way up.
