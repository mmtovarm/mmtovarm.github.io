[MY PORTFOLIO SITE](https://mmtovarm.github.io/)
## Project Requirements
### Content
- [MY PURPOSE]
The goal of this project is to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS I have learned during the SheCodes learning program and showcase it to my mentors for feedback. I will aim for a MVP, starting with a basic wireframe, with full understanding of the process and basic techniques learnt. Was not able to finish but I will continue to work.

## WIREFRAME
